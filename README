Description:

LabView codes to implement the lab exercises proposed in 
"Digital Communications: Physical Layer Exploration Lab Using The NI USRP Platform"
By Robert W. Heath Jr., Ph.D., P.E.
Those are my implementations for the Penn State's EE497E SDR course.
To run it, just open Simulator and check if the communication goes well.
If you have the NI USRP it is possible to run it with the equipment by configuring it
in top_tx and top_rx and using them to see wireless communication.
